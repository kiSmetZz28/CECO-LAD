# Overview

In this repository, you will find a Python implementation of CECO-LAD: a Cloud-Edge Collaboration Framework for Unsupervised Log Anomaly Detection.

# Introduction to CECO-LAD

Artificial intelligence (AI)-driven Log Anomaly Detection (LAD) is a critical component for maintaining the security and reliability of cyber infrastructure. However, deploying an effective LAD system in real-world environments presents a significant challenge, the cloud-edge dilemma, where accurate deep learning models favor centralized cloud resources, but operational constraints (e.g., latency, bandwidth, privacy, and energy) favor edge-local analysis. To address these challenges, we propose CECO-LAD, a cloud-edge collaborative framework for unsupervised log anomaly detection that balances detection accuracy with resource efficiency. In CECO-LAD, we propose an enhanced version of Anomaly Transformer (AT) as a base learner. Building on enhanced AT, we further proposed a novel ensemble learning approach as the core of CECO-LAD: the BAT for cloud deployment and Q-BAT for resource-constrained edge environments. A Mahalanobis distance-based routing policy enables cloud-edge collaboration by selectively forwarding only uncertain samples to the cloud and retaining confident cases at the edge, thereby minimizing resource consumption while maximizing detection accuracy. Additionally, we propose Green-LADE, a Green AI-inspired method to enable holistic evaluation.

# Get Started

## Configuration

### Cloud

- Ubuntu 24.04
- NVIDIA driver 580.126.09
- CUDA 12.4
- Python version >= 3.8
- PyTorch 2.4.0+cu124

### Edge

- Ubuntu 20.04
- Python 3.10
- PyTorch 2.4.0

## Installation

This code requires the packages listed in environment.yml and requirements.txt. The conda environments are recommended to run this code:

```bash
conda env create -f ./environment/cloud/environment.yml
conda activate ceco-lad-cloud
pip install -r ./environment/cloud/requirements.txt
```

```bash
conda env create -f ./environment/edge/environment.yml
conda activate ceco-lad-edge
pip install -r ./environment/edge/requirements.txt
```

## Download Data

CECO-LAD and other baseline methods are implemented on [HDFS](https://github.com/logpai/loghub/tree/master/HDFS), [OpenStack](https://github.com/logpai/loghub/tree/master/OpenStack), and [BGL](https://github.com/logpai/loghub/tree/master/BGL) datasets. These datasets are available on [LogHub](https://github.com/logpai/loghub). You can also obtain these datasets that are well pre-processed from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1iBBTYIx1DaEV5lDh6dO7L6Klb15wUHcI?usp=drive_link).

## Download Trained Model

The trained BAT and Q-BAT models can be downloaded from the [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1dh_pSu5M7fZVIWpdwfyBa4OLC4MKO1N0?usp=drive_link).

# Experiment

## BAT Model

For BAT, it is bagging based ensemble, we use 81 base models for bagging in CECO-LAD. To ensure robustness, we use four parameters:num_epochs, k (loss weight), e_layer_num (number of encoder layer), and batch_size. The detailed configs for BAT are provided in ./model_config/bat_config.

```bash
cd Cloud

# To train BAT model
python train_ensemble.py

# To test BAT model
python test_ensemble.py --voting majority
```

## Edge-based Q-BAT

Here we use [ExecuTorch](https://docs.pytorch.org/executorch/0.3/) (version 0.3) for lowering the model for Q-BAT at the edge. We have already included the executorch in our project.

If you want to try by your self for the start, according to the guideline of ExecuTorch, you can clone and install ExecuTorch locally.

```bash
cd Edge

git clone --branch v0.3.0 https://github.com/pytorch/executorch.git
cd executorch

# Update and pull submodules
git submodule sync
git submodule update --init

# Install ExecuTorch pip package and its dependencies, as well as
# development tools like CMake.
# If developing on a Mac, make sure to install the Xcode Command Line Tools first.
./install_requirements.sh

# Clean and configure the CMake build system. Compiled programs will appear in the executorch/cmake-out directory we create here.
(rm -rf cmake-out && mkdir cmake-out && cd cmake-out && cmake ..)

# Build the executor_runner target
cmake --build cmake-out --target executor_runner -j9
```

### Runner Customize

After downloading and setting up the executorch, we need to customize the executor_runner to enable the customized input data. By replacing the executor_runner.cpp in the folder ./executorch/examples/portable/executor_runner to enable user customized runner. (We have already updated the file in the current version)

After updating the executor_runner file, build the the executor_runner target again:

```bash
# Build the executor_runner target
cmake --build cmake-out --target executor_runner -j9
```

### Model conversion

For Q-BAT model, we utilize executorch and torchao for edge optimization and quantization. To quantize the model and convert from .pth to .pte file, please run the following:

```bash
python convert_torchao.py
```

### Model Inference

To save time, both the trained Q-BAT models and the preprocessed datasets for executing at the edge can be downloaded from the [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1pBNMsucvw1eypn5gC_QvOzeRnMgTzLq2?usp=drive_link).

To execute the Q-BAT model accross all the datasets, run the scripts:

```bash
./edge_scripts/edge_execute.sh
```

## Demo

We provide the experiment scripts of all benchmarks under the folder ./scripts. You can reproduce the experiment results as follows:

```bash
bash ./scripts/run.sh
```

or you can directly run the command in the python console:

```bash
# BAT training

```
